Since the introduction of the Chippendale Creative Precinct in 2010, this gritty, central neighbourhood has been turning heads, as top chefs and artists fill the open spaces.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe Creative Precinct is headed up by Nicky Ginsberg, and it appears she isn‚Äôt the only of the Ginsberg family caught in the thick of Chippendale‚Äôs restoration. Daughter Katya has recently made headlines with the opening of The Chip Off the Old Block. The new small bar on Little Queen Street is in the downstairs space of a gothic-revival church.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôre a hospitality family,‚Äù Ginsberg says, ‚Äúwhich is how I got the inspiration for the name; I‚Äôm a bit of a chip off the old block, so to speak.‚Äù Playing on not only the family‚Äôs English heritage but on that of the suburb, Ginsberg wanted to introduce a venue which would send expats and travellers on a journey back to the motherland.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBacon butty sarnies, bubble and squeak pie and fish and chips wrapped in newspaper share space on a menu that is as English as they come. The cocktail list matches well, full of English idioms. Gin & Bear It mixes gin, cinnamon whisky, orange and ginger beer and an English Rose is a sweetly simple mix of Hendrick‚Äôs, rose syrup and cucumber.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe beer and wine isn‚Äôt as Brit influenced. A list of craft beers only includes four British imports and wines are mainly from Australia, bar a couple of French numbers. Beers come in bottles tucked into brown-paper bags, and cocktails come in an array of jars and haphazard glassware; a likely choice but we can‚Äôt help but feel that Sydney may be approaching its capacity for drinking out of a jar.</P"], ["url", "http://thechipofftheoldblock.com.au"]]

Owned and operated by Ben Touass ‚Äì the very French, very inspired mind who launched Darlinghurst‚Äôs Pocket Bar ‚Äì Assembly manages to merge childish abandon with a great deal of taste and refinement.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nDescending the escalator from George Street, you can look down on Assembly‚Äôs artificial courtyard, complete with Astroturf, picnic tables and enough plastic ivy to consume a rather large wall. Its kindergarten qualities immediately conjure memories of recess and hopscotch, although the name Assembly doesn‚Äôt refer to any deliberate theme.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nInside, the mood takes a less adolescent turn. The warm glow of industrial lights illuminates sections of the open-plan space, while makeshift walls constructed from loading pallets split the room into more intimate squares. A set of spiral stairs ascends to a lofty lounge area above the bar, where an ingenious drink-elevator hoists refreshments from the bar below.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nPrepared with ninja-like athleticism, Assembly boasts a swathe of classic, original and sponsored cocktails. Doing away with longwinded sensory descriptions, they appear on the menu as simple equations like ‚Äú2 x (gin + maraschino liqueur + green chartreuse + lime juice) shaken & strained + chilled martini glass = Last Words‚Äù. There‚Äôs a creative and semi-scientific style to some cocktails such as the Lavender Hill Cappuccino, a concoction of French rum, lime and cloudy apple juice with a thick apple and lavender foam garnished with a pop-rock filled mint leaf.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAn equally creative food menu goes beyond the realms of snacking, encompassing soul food and sizable share plates that compliment wine and cocktails alike. Anything from their selection of gourmet hotdogs would be our recommendation.</p>"]]
